<h3 class="text-center">My Rating System</h3>
<p class="text-center">
  Traditional number rating systems have massive issues. One is the fact an average score is considered bad, 5/10 should not mean itâ€™s bad.
  Secondly traditional ratings make it hard to separate their opinion on the game and if and how much they recommend a game, as these things are not mutually exclusive.
Because of this, each review will conclude with my overall opinions and my recommendation. No rating will be given, but for the very best and very worst, there are some yummy rewards.
